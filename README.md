Since I've started a new course on _competitive programming_, I've decided to study this old and new (for me) program language. **C++** is not a standard for this discipline, but is a best practice to use it for more "efficient" programs. Other program languages that you can use are:
- **Python**;
- **Java**;
- **C**.

I'm going to create some "lessons" where I'll put che code that I'm going to create to understand how it works.
