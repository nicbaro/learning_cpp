# LEARNING C++

Since I've started a new course on _competitive programming_, I've decided to study this old and new (for me) program language. **C++** is not a standard for this discipline, but is a best practice to use it for more "efficient" programs. Other program languages that you can use are:

- **Python**;
- **Java**;
- **C**.

I'm going to create some "lessons" where I'll put che code that I'm going to create to understand how it works. Hope you enjoy <3

C++ is an extension of C. So, the way to initialize variables and data type are the same of C. To print output you have to use an object called cout and to take an input you have to use cin. The standard Library to import is <iostream> and to avoid writing on each line std:: I have to write "using namespace std". For example:

```c++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  cout << "Hello World!";
  return 0;
}
```
